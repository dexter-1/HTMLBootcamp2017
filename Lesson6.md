## Integrating Your Website with Facebook
What if someone goes to your website and really likes it a lot and wants to let you know? Or what if someone wants to like your website and you want to keep track of all of those likes? We can do this using Facebook! Before we get started, we need to create a website using Github.

### Creating Github Page
I have been using Github as our class website, but what I haven't told you is that Github is a very useful website that almost all coders use! It can do a lot of cool things, and one of them is publish your own website!

What do I mean by publishing a website? That basically means putting all of your HTML and CSS under a link so that anyone around the world can visit that link and see your website.

Thimble actually publishes our website and even gives you a link that you can share. So why would we need to use Github to publish our website? Well one reason is that the links like https://thimbleprojects.org/projectinclude-dr/300137/ are very hard to remember. Maybe we would want our link to be something like dexterrivera.com. Thimble does not allow us to add our own links, but Github will. Unfortunately however, to get a link like dexterrivera.com, you need to pay for it. They are typically very cheap like $1 though.

We need to use Github to publish our websites because Facebook will not let us use our links that we get from Thimble.

To publish your website on Github, follow the instructions on this page: https://pages.github.com/. Make sure that you have a Github account set up. Under "Ready to get started? Roll vanilla, or generate a site for your project" click "Project Site" and under "Use a theme, or start from scratch" select "Start from scratch".

For step 1, make sure you create a new repository. A repository is a place where we can store all of our code and other people will be able to see it. Click on [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) and give it a name, for example "DextersWebsite". The name cannot have any spaces. Check off the last box that says "Initialize this repository with a ReadME". Then click "Create repository".

For now, you can skip steps 2 and 3 and just complete step 4 to finish. Once you complete step 4, your new link will be as follows:

```
USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORYNAME
```

`USERNAME` will be your github username and repository name is the name of the repository you created. Once this is done you are create to begin integration with Facebook!

## Comments Section
To create a comments section that looks something like this:

Follow the instructions on https://www.webascender.com/blog/add-facebook-comments-website/. When you are adding the App Domain, use the link that you make with Github!

Once you get the comment section, put that section inside the Semantic UI segment like in the above picture.

## Like and Share
To create a like button and share button, follow the instructions on https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button.

After you add these sections, feel free to look through the all of the other buttons you can add on https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins. Once you are finished, start finishing the rest of the challenges, which can all be found in the file Challenges.md! If you are finished those, feel free to keep working on your own website. Ask me if you have any cool things that you want to add to your website and we can work on that together!
