Welcome to the final week of our bootcamp! In this last week, do some final changes to our websites so that they are ready for everyone to see if they are given a link! I suggest you first complete all of the challenges in the `Challenges.md` file before going through with this lesson. I have posted all of the solutions to the challenges in the `Solutions.md` file. You can take a look at my website [here](https://thimbleprojects.org/projectinclude-dr/300137/).

The first thing that we will do is change the information that you see on the tab in the browser so that it is personalized for your website. It will end up looking something like this:

### Changing The Title That Appears on The Browser Tab
This part is very easy! By now, you should have a `<head></head>` tag in your code. If you do not, add it to the top of your code above the `<body></body>` tags. To change the text that appears on the tab, use the `<title></title>` tag like so:

```html
<head>
	<title>Dexter's Website</title>
	...
</head>
```

It's that easy!

### Changing The Icon That Appears on the Browser
To change the little icon that appears beside the title of your website, all we need to do is add this tag:

```html
<head>
	...
	<link rel="shortcut icon" href="https://heatherchristenaschmidt.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/facebook_no_profile_pic2-jpg.gif" type="image/x-icon">
	...
</head>
```

The only thing we need to change is the `href` attribute, which should be a picture of the image you want there. Again, very easy!

## Conclusion and Next Steps
This marks the end of our bootcamps! I hope you all learned a lot and have really cool websites! I hope you all now also love coding as much as I do!

I encourage you to continue working on your website outside of class and adding more and more cool features to it. Please feel free to send me an email at `dexter.rivera@mail.utoronto.ca` or post a question on the issues tab on our class website on Github if you have any more questions after this session!

Finally, when you feel like you have masters HTML and CSS, the next thing you should try to learn is Javascript. If you remember from our first lesson, if we think of building a website as building a house, HTML is the walls and floors, CSS is the furniture and paintings, and Javascript are all the appliances. We need Javascript to do cool things like make stuff move when you click on buttons. We can also use Javascript to make cool games!

To start learn about Javascript on your own, visit [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). As you will see, it is very different from HTML and CSS, and much harder. Try your best to learn it on your own, but if you are stuck, do not worry! Javascript is fairly advanced and it is best learned in high school after taking a class on coding.

Congratulations on completing our HTML and CSS bootcamps! ðŸŽ‰ Go on and code some cool things with the stuff you learned!
